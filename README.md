## ðŸ“¦ What It Does

This plugin installs all files from the `hooks/` directory into your project's `.git/hooks/` directory, replacing any existing ones. It also ensures all copied files are executable.

Useful when working in teams to ensure Git hooks (e.g., pre-commit, pre-push) are consistently installed.

## ðŸ›  How to Use
